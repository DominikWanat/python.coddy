# In this project, we will build a Contact Book application 
# step by step by breaking it into small, manageable functions.
# The first step is to create a display_menu function.

# Create a function named display_menu that prints the main menu
# options for the Contact Book.

# The menu should include the following options:

# Add Contact
# View Contact
# Edit Contact
# Delete Contact
# List All Contacts
# Exit

# This function will be the starting point of the program, helping
# users navigate through the options.

def display_menu():
    print('Contact Book Menu:')
    print('1. Add Concat')
    print('2. View Contact')
    print('3. Edit Contact')
    print('4. Delete Contact')
    print('5. List All Contacts')
    print('6. Exit')


display_menu()
