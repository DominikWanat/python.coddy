# Create a function named calculate_discount that takes two parameters:

# price: The original price of an item (float)
# discount_percentage: The discount percentage (float)
# The function should:

# Calculate the discount amount
# Subtract the discount amount from the original price
# Round the result to 2 decimal places
# Return the final discounted price
# For example, if the original price is $100 and the discount is 20%, the function should return $80.00.
